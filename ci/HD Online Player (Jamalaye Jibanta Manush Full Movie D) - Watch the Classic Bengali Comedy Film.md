The film revolves around Siddheshwar (Bhanu Bandopadhyay), a young and hardworking villager who is in love with Madhuri (Basabi Nandi), the daughter of a rich businessman named Hari (Chhabi Biswas). Hari despises Siddheshwar and tries to stop their marriage by beating him up and kidnapping Madhuri. Siddheshwar survives but Madhuri thinks he is dead and commits suicide. A heartbroken Siddheshwar leaves the village and wanders around until he meets the disciples of Lord Yama (the god of death) who are looking for a corpse. Siddheshwar tricks them and enters the court of Lord Yama alive. He enjoys his experience in the underworld and drives Yama, Chitragupta (the god of justice) and Narod (Yama's messenger) crazy. They seek help from Lord Vishnu (the supreme god) who disguises himself as a human and befriends Siddheshwar. Siddheshwar tells him about the sufferings of human beings on earth and also expresses his desire to see his beloved Madhuri once again. He gets a glimpse of Madhuri in heaven and pleads to the gods to revive her. Finally, Goddess Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth and Vishnu's consort) grants his wish and reunites him with Madhuri.
