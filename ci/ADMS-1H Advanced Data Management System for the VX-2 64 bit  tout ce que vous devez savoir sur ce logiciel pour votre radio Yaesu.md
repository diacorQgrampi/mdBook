## What is ADMS-1H?
 
ADMS-1H stands for Advanced Data Management System for the VX-2 64 bit. It is a software solution that integrates with the VX-2 64 bit hardware to provide a comprehensive data platform that can support various data applications and workflows.
 
ADMS-1H is based on a distributed architecture that leverages the power of multiple VX-2 64 bit nodes to create a scalable and resilient data cluster. The cluster can store, process and analyze data in parallel, using advanced algorithms and techniques such as compression, encryption, deduplication, replication and backup.
 
ADMS-1H also provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily manage and monitor your data cluster, as well as access various tools and features such as query engine, dashboard, report generator, data explorer and more.
 
## How does ADMS-1H work?
 
To use ADMS-1H, you need to install it on your VX-2 64 bit nodes. You can choose how many nodes you want to include in your data cluster, depending on your data needs and budget. The minimum requirement is two nodes, but you can add more nodes as your data grows or as you need more performance.
 
Once you have installed ADMS-1H on your nodes, you can connect them using a high-speed network. ADMS-1H will automatically detect and configure your nodes to form a data cluster. You can then use the ADMS-1H interface to create and manage your data volumes, which are logical units of storage that can span across multiple nodes.
 
You can then load your data into your data volumes using various methods such as file transfer, streaming, ingestion or API. ADMS-1H will automatically distribute and balance your data across the cluster, ensuring optimal performance and availability. You can also apply various settings and policies to your data volumes such as compression level, encryption key, replication factor and backup schedule.
 
Once you have loaded your data into your data volumes, you can start using ADMS-1H to perform various data operations such as querying, analyzing, visualizing and reporting. You can use the built-in tools and features of ADMS-1H or integrate with external applications and platforms such as SQL, Python, R, Spark, Hadoop and more.
